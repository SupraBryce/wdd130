    <h2>Bryce Bartschi</h2>
    <p>Im currently working towards my bachelors, although I pretty much just started. I think programming is pretty interesting and has a lot of potiental in the world currently.</p>
    <p>In my down time, I enjoy working on cars. I'm in the works of getting a new money pit project car to restore and build up. I also enjoy playing video games with my friends whenever we get the chance.</p>
    <p>I am not in a relationship currently, although im not really putting any effort into it. I work full time at a car dealership washing new and used cars for people. This is not a permanent job thankfully, I am hoping to find a job in the future that goes along with my degree path.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life. Im really greatful that the church has this program to help us get a good kickstart into schooling/ our future.</p>
